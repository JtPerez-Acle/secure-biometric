### Implementation Details

#### 2.1 Backend Core Development (Rust)
- **Wallet Creation**
  - Implement secure key generation (using libraries like rand and ed25519-dalek or similar)

#### 2.2 Initial Biometric Authentication Integration
- **Focus**: Facial recognition as starting point due to relative ease of initial implementation using libraries like image and potentially integrating with pre-trained model from MediaPipe or similar
- **Workflow**: User registers face data (encrypted and stored securely, not directly on-chain). Authentication involves capturing new image and comparing it to stored template
- **Security Considerations**: Initial implementation will focus on basic functionality. Advanced security measures against spoofing will be addressed in later milestones

- **Interaction**: Test basic wallet operations on blockchain testnet

### Deliverables for Milestone 2

- **Spoken Phrase Verification**: Integrate with speech-to-text and natural language processing libraries to verify predefined spoken phrase
- **Implementation**: Backend generates random challenge (gesture or phrase). Frontend captures user input, and backend verifies it against expected response
- **Security Considerations**: Implement measures to prevent replay attacks and ensure challenges are sufficiently complex

#### 3.2 On-Chain Metadata Storage
- **Smart Contract Development**: Develop smart contract on chosen blockchain to store interaction metadata
- **Data to Store**: Timestamps of authentication attempts, biometric data hashes (not raw data), behavioral patterns (e.g., typing speed, mouse movements â€“ anonymized and aggregated), challenge response patterns
- **Encryption**: Encrypt metadata before storing it on-chain to protect user privacy. Use key derived from user's wallet or separate secure key management system
- **Integration**: Modify backend to interact with smart contract to store and retrieve metadata

#### 3.3 Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) for Verification
- **Use Case**: Verify user identity or specific attributes without revealing underlying data. For example, proving age or location without revealing exact date of birth or coordinates
- **Library Integration**: Utilize Rust-based ZKP libraries like arkworks or bellman
- **Implementation**:
  - **Proof Generation**: User's device generates ZKP based on private data
  - **Proof Verification**: Backend verifies ZKP without accessing private data
- **Example**: Verifying that user has completed KYC without revealing specific KYC information

#### 3.4 Enhanced Fraud Detection
- **Blockchain Log Analysis**: Analyze on-chain transaction history and metadata for suspicious patterns (e.g., unusual transaction amounts, frequent failed authentication attempts, changes in behavioral patterns)
- **Anomaly Detection**: Implement algorithms to identify deviations from normal user behavior
- **Alerting System**: Trigger alerts for suspicious activity, potentially requiring additional authentication steps or temporarily suspending account

### Deliverables for Milestone 3
